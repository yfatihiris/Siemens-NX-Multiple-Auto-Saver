# Siemens-NX-Multiple-Auto-Saver
By setting the recording time with this Siemens NX extension you can get an infinite amount of records at different times from the same file. As it is known in NX, it is quite difficult to go back, but this project makes it very easy to return to old files by recording endlessly at certain time intervals.


To use this extension, download the code and set the duration. Enter the inputs correctly and use them easily
